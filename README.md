# Google Poly Model Viewer in ReactVR
-----------------------

## How to Run

1. Npm install or yarn add to get dependencies, if you haven't already. 

2. Open a terminal and use 'npm run start'.

3. Open a second terminal and use 'node devserver.js', or, preferably, `npm install -g nodemon' so you can use the Nodemon reload tool whenever there are changes in your project.

4. Send me a pull request once you are able to get support for the Cardboard VR magnet button and Samsung Gear VR Controls!
